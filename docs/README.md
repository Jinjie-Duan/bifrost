# Welcome to bifrost's documentation

Bifrost is a sharing platform/LIMS for data analysis currently focused on bacterial quality control (QC).

Bifrost is being developed by Statens Serum Institut (SSI) for tracking collections of samples at the sample level. By tracking what analyses have been run against each sample in a centralized database (DB) we can perform rapid routine analysis against all values that enter the system.

To ensure that the analyses are accurate it is important to run and track each sample through QC which is appropriate for the downstream analysis you want to perform and is thus a central component of bifrost.

A centralized DB also gives greater power in analyzing your sample collection through either direct DB interaction or via bifrost's web based graphical user interface (GUI).

Bifrost provides a platform allowing for real-time information on how a new sample compares against all existing DB samples enabling more data-based approaches for analysis.

Bifrost has been implemented at SSI and we are as of this writing in the process to rolling this platform out to all clinical microbiology labs in Denmark and will see continued development to fulfill the needs of software as infrastructure.
