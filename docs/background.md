# Background

Bifrost is being developed with the concept that data analysis should be tracked downstream through the use of components. The idea is that summarized values are often used for downstream analysis and that we should encourage running standardized components on samples or collections of samples. This serves the purpose of both centralizing the results and encouraging the use of standard tools for analysis. The first components for bifrost have all been developed based on quality control of bacterial WGS samples. If the resulting data is standardized then visual analysis tools can be built on top of the summarized data and pool information from all samples that have also run the same component and additional metrics can be discovered more easilly off the pooled datasets.

Bifrost is a platform whose philosophy is to impose structure on data analysis, so it is unsurprising that organizing the structure of the underlying data on your server is important to how bifrost optimally functions. The following is what we recommend for setting up bifrost. As background our structure is used at Statens Serum Institut which now handles >10,000 bacterial WGS samples per year.
